I embarked on the Coder Odyssey Quest with a burning desire to prepare for my coming intership. 

I'm diving into the "Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers" on Udemy, because let’s face it—Java mastery is non-negotiable for my upcoming internship. But that’s not all! I’m also tackling the "DevOps Fundamentals on AWS" course to get my feet wet in the world of DevOps.

In this GitHub repository, you’ll find my journey documented through code, from Java newbie to (hopefully) Java wizard, with a side of DevOps sprinkled in. The projects here are my way of saying, “Look, I’m sharpening my skills and having a blast doing it!”

Stay tuned—this repo will be evolving as I conquer each lesson and turn theory into practice.





Here are the courses I'm going to follow:
