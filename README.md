  <h1 align="center">Cyber & DevOps Journey 🔐🚀</h1>
</p>

Over the next three months, I'm dedicating myself to a structured learning journey to become fully prepared for my upcoming internship in **Cybersecurity and DevOps** at Cegedim.

To reach this goal, I’ve selected courses and tools essential to these fields. This GitHub repository documents my progress with projects, exercises, and notes on each skill acquired, from GDPR compliance and Privacy by Design practices to secure and automated deployments.

By following this path, my aim is to be **operational from day one**. Stay tuned for updates as I turn new knowledge into practice week by week!
