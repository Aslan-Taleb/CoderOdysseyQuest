  <h1 align="center">Cyber & DevOps Journey üîêüöÄ</h1>
</p>

Over the next three months, I‚Äôm dedicating 1.5 hours per day, alongside my master‚Äôs studies, to a structured learning journey that will prepare me for my upcoming internship in **Cybersecurity and DevOps** at Cegedim.

To reach this goal, I‚Äôve outlined a daily learning plan to master key tools and concepts in cybersecurity and DevOps. This GitHub repository documents my progress with projects, exercises, and notes on each skill acquired. Follow along as I turn this knowledge into practical experience!
